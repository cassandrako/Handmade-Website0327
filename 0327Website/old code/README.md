# Handmade-Website0327

I was working on my project this weekend and I don't really like the direction of my portfolio website-- I already have one and I don't think I can make this one better in the time frame given as I felt the extent of my html knowledge only made ugly static 2D corporate looking websites.

I wanted to create a website for cooking in university as I never cooked before moving away from home (also it's something me and my siblings kinda all share in common now). I've been a little busy working on my onboarding and things unrelated to school-- my head is kinda all over the place after break, so this isn't particularly my best work but I will be working on it towards the deadline. 

I hope you don't mind that it looks a little rough right now, but I'm working on making it pretty. I don't know if I explained my issue that well but please let me know if I did not and I can try to reiterate myself.
